# SupplySight - Deployment & Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

This guide will help you deploy and test the SupplySight inventory management system with all its features.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v5 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher) - for ML service
- Git

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SupplySight

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Install ML service dependencies
cd ../ml-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/supplysight

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Start MongoDB (if not running)
mongod

# In a new terminal, navigate to backend and seed the database
cd backend
npm run seed
```

## üéØ Demo Data

The seed script creates comprehensive demo data including:

- **5 Users**: 2 managers, 3 customers
- **3 Stores**: Different locations with geospatial data
- **17 Items**: Various categories (smartphones, laptops, audio, gaming, etc.)
- **50+ Orders**: Historical order data for ML analysis
- **Multiple Notifications**: Low stock, out of stock, and ML suggestions

### Demo Credentials

**Manager Account:**
- Email: `manager1@test.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Customer Account:**
- Email: `customer1@test.com`
- Password: `password123`

## üöÄ Running the Application

### 1. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Start ML Service (Optional)

```bash
cd ml-service
python api.py
```

The ML service will start on `http://localhost:8000`
